	Hi, my name is Johnny Tsao (Bing-Jyun Tsao). I am from Taipei, Taiwan. I am currently enrolled in University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign as a physics major. I am interested in physics, mathematics, and computer science. As for my leisure time, I usually play badminton, table tennis, and board games. My future goal is to become a physicist. I am particularly interested in gravitational waves, colliding black holes, and other general relativity effects, and one day I want to use my skills in computer simulation to get to know more about these interesting yet myterious phenomena.

		1. The velocity and amplitude of interface Waves in two-layer fluid
	</p>
		A resarch on the interface waves formed between saline and water. By adjusting variables such as the thickness, density, and the height difference of the fluids, the experiment aimed to analyze the amplitude and velocity of the interface waves and found the relationship between these parameters and the variables.

		2. Two-Layer fluid 3D simulation
	</p>
		A simulation of the previous project with VPython 3D simulation. Uses Navier-Stokes equation to simulate the fluid's motion.

		3. Fire Evacuation Simulation
	</p>
		A simulation of people's movement and survive strategy when a fire occurs. Changing the rate of fire, number of people, and the radius of an obstacle to get the best survival rate.

		4. Flight Radiation Exposure Simulation
	</p>
		A simulation of the radiation absorbed by the airplane. Using a simulation of eletrons' and protons' motion in earth's magnetic field to calculate the probability in entering the earth's surface. Then, use the data and visualize the radiation exposure of a specific flight route.
